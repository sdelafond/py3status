Description: extensible i3status wrapper written in Python (Python3 package)
 Using py3status, you can take control of your i3bar easily by:
 .
  - using one of the available shipped with py3status
  - grouping multiple modules and automatically or manually cycle their display
  - writing your own modules and have their output displayed on your bar
  - handling click events on your i3bar and play with them in no time
  - seeing your clock tick every second whatever your i3status interval
 .
 No extra configuration file needed, i3status' one will be used directly
 .
 This is the Python3 package
